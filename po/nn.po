"Prior to installing openSUSE on a system that boots using UEFI (Unified "
"Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to check for any "
"firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and, if available, to "
"install such an update. A pre-installed Windows 8 is a strong indication "
"that your system boots using UEFI."

"<emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that cause it "
"to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage area. Nobody "
"really knows how much \"too much\" is, though. openSUSE minimizes the risk "
"by not writing more than the bare minimum required to boot the OS. The "
"minimum means telling the UEFI firmware about the location of the openSUSE "
"boot loader. Upstream Linux Kernel features that use the UEFI storage area "
"for storing boot and crash information (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been "
"disabled by default. Nevertheless, it is recommended to install any firmware "
"updates the hardware vendor recommends."

"Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of partitioning "

"Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS) "
"partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB2) try to automatically "
"generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write them to the firmware. "
"Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a rewrite in the firmware. A "
"rewrite consist of two different operation: removing the old entry and "
"creating a new entry that replaces the first one."
