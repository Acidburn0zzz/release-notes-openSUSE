msgid "Prior to installing openSUSE on a system that boots using UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to check for any firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and, if available, to install such an update.

#: xml/release-notes.xml:127(para)
msgid "<emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that cause it to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage area. Nobody really knows how much \"too much\" is, though. openSUSE minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum required to boot the OS. The minimum means telling the UEFI firmware about the location of the openSUSE boot loader. Upstream Linux Kernel features that use the UEFI storage area for storing boot and crash information (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been disabled by default. Nevertheless, it is recommended to install any firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends."

msgstr ""

#: xml/release-notes.xml:151(para)
msgid "Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS) partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB2) try to automatically generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write them to the firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a rewrite in the firmware. A rewrite consist of two different operation: removing the old entry and creating a new entry that replaces the first one."

#: xml/release-notes.xml:160(para)
msgid "Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted entries and frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem arises when faulty firmware does not collect and free those entries; this may end up with a non-bootable system."

By adding '/version=1.1' to ServerName in client.conf (e.g., ServerName older.server.example.com/version=1.1) or to the CUPS_SERVER environment variable value or by adding it to the server name value of the '-h' option (e.g., lpstat -h older.server.example.com/version=1.1 -p) the older IPP protocol version for older servers must be specified explicitly."
