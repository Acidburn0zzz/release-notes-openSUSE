   <title>Base System Installation</title>
   <para>
    If you install a new system as <quote>minimal base system</quote>,
    the installed system will try to maintain this level and often run
    into dependency conflicts when you try to install more software.
   </para>
   <para>
    To avoid this, uninstall the package
    <literal>patterns-openSUSE-minimal_base-conflicts</literal>,
    instructing the system that you no longer want to maintain a minimal
    installation (<quote>minimal base system</quote>).
   </para>
   <para>
    Also, <literal>SuSEfirewall2</literal> and <literal>yast2</literal> have been removed from the 
    <quote>minimal base system</quote>
    as it requires a full Perl installation and it would not be
    necessary in all contexts. If you need it you may select 
    <literal>SuSEfirewall2</literal> or <literal>patterns-openSUSE-yast2_basis</literal>.

  <section id="sec.123.uefi">
   <title>UEFI&mdash;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</title>
   <para>
    Prior to installing openSUSE on a system that boots using UEFI
    (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), you are urgently advised to
    check for any firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends and,
    if available, to install such an update. A pre-installed Windows 8
    is a strong indication that your system boots using UEFI.
   </para>

   <para>
    <emphasis>Background:</emphasis> Some UEFI firmware has bugs that
    cause it to break if too much data gets written to the UEFI storage
    area. Nobody really knows how much "too much" is, though.  openSUSE
    minimizes the risk by not writing more than the bare minimum
    required to boot the OS.  The minimum means telling the UEFI
    firmware about the location of the openSUSE boot loader.  Upstream
    Linux Kernel features that use the UEFI storage area for storing
    boot and crash information (<literal>pstore</literal>) have been
    disabled by default. Nevertheless, it is recommended to install any
    firmware updates the hardware vendor recommends.

   <title>UEFI, GPT, and MS-DOS Partitions</title>
   <para>
    Together with the EFI/UEFI specification, a new style of
    partitioning arrived: GPT (GUID Partition Table). This new schema
    uses globally unique identifiers (128-bit values displayed in 32
    hexadecimal digits) to identify devices and partition types.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, the UEFI specification also allows legacy MBR (MS-DOS)
    partitions. The Linux boot loaders (ELILO or GRUB2) try to
    automatically generate a GUID for those legacy partitions, and write
    them to the firmware. Such a GUID can change frequently, causing a
    rewrite in the firmware. A rewrite consist of two different
    operation: removing the old entry and creating a new entry that
    replaces the first one.
   </para>
   <para>
    Modern firmware has a garbage collector that collects deleted
    entries and frees the memory reserved for old entries. A problem
    arises when faulty firmware does not collect and free those entries;
    this may end up with a non-bootable system.
   </para>
   <para>
    The workaround is simple: convert the legacy MBR partition to the
    new GPT to avoid this problem completely.
   </para>

        <title>Printing System: Improvements and Incompatible Changes</title>
        <!-- href="https://fate.novell.com/314630" -->
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">CUPS Version Upgrade to 1.7</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>CUPS &gt;= 1.6 has major incompatible changes compared to CUPS up to version 1.5.4 in particular when printing via network:</para>
        <para> The IPP protocol default version increased from 1.1 to 2.0. Older IPP servers like CUPS 1.3.x (for example in SLE 11) reject IPP 2.0 requests with "Bad Request" (see <ulink url="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4231">http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4231</ulink> ). By adding '/version=1.1' to ServerName in client.conf (e.g., ServerName older.server.example.com/version=1.1) or to the CUPS_SERVER environment variable value or by adding it to the server name value of the '-h' option (e.g., lpstat -h older.server.example.com/version=1.1 -p) the older IPP protocol version for older servers must be specified explicitly. </para>
        <para> CUPS Browsing is dropped in CUPS but the new package cups-filters provides the cups-browsed that provides basic CUPS Browsing and Polling functionality. The native protocol in CUPS for automatic client discovery of printers is now DNS-SD. Start cups-browsed on the local host to receive traditional CUPS Browsing information from traditional remote CUPS servers. To broadcast traditional CUPS Browsing information into the network so that traditional remote CUPS clients can receive it, set "BrowseLocalProtocols CUPS" in <literal moreinfo="none">/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf</literal> and start cups-browsed. </para>
        <para>Some printing filters and back-ends are dropped in CUPS but the new package cups-filters provides them. So cups-filters is usually needed (recommended by RPM) but cups-filters is not strictly required.</para>
        <para> The cupsd configuration directives are split into two files: cupsd.conf (can also be modified via HTTP PUT e.g. via cupsctl) and cups-files.conf (can only be modified manually by root) to have better default protection against misuse of privileges by normal users who have been specifically allowed by root to do cupsd configuration changes (see <ulink url="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4223">http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4223</ulink> , CVE-2012-5519, and bnc#789566). </para>
        <para> CUPS banners and the CUPS test page are no longer supported since CUPS &gt;= 1.6. The banners and the test page from cups-filters must be used. The CUPS banner files in <literal moreinfo="none">/usr/share/cups/banners/</literal> and the CUPS testpage <literal moreinfo="none">/usr/share/cups/data/testprint</literal> (which is also a CUPS banner file type) are no longer provided in the cups RPM because they do no longer work since CUPS &gt;= 1.6 (see <ulink url="http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4120">http://www.cups.org/str.php?L4120</ulink> ) because there is no longer a filter that can convert the CUPS banner files. Since CUPS &gt;= 1.6 only the banner files and testpage in the cups-filters package work via the cups-filters PDF workflow and the cups-filters package also provides the matching bannertopdf filter. </para>
        <para>For details, see bsc#735404.</para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">PDF Now Common Printing Data Format</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>There is a general move away from PostScript to PDF as the standard print job format. This change is advocated by the OpenPrinting workgroup of the Linux Foundation and the CUPS author.</para>
        <para>This means that application programs usually no longer produce PostScript output by default when printing but instead PDF.</para>
        <para>As a consequence the default processing how application programs printing output is converted into the "language" that the particular printer accepts (the so called "CUPS filter chain") has fundamentally changed from a PostScript-centric workflow to a PDF-centric workflow.</para>
        <para>Accordingly the upstream standard for CUPS under Linux (using CUPS plus the cups-filters package) is now PDF-based job processing, letting every non-PDF input be converted to PDF first, page management options being applied by a pdftopdf filter and Ghostscript being called with PDF as input.</para>
        <para>With PDF as the standard print job format traditional PostScript printers can no longer print application's printing output directly so that a conversion step in the printing workflow is required that converts PDF into PostScript. But there are also PostScript+PDF printers that can print both PostScript and PDF directly.</para>
        <para> For details, see the section "Common printing data formats" in the SUSE wiki article "Concepts printing" at <ulink url="http://en.opensuse.org/Concepts_printing">http://en.opensuse.org/Concepts_printing</ulink> . </para>
